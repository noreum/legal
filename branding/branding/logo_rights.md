### 🎨 Brand Usage Policy

The Noreum brand operates with two primary logo variants — **gold** and **black** — each serving a distinct visual context.

| Variant | Intended Use | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Gold Logo** (`noreum-logo-gold.png`) | Official, ceremonial, or high-visibility contexts — such as whitepapers, press releases, website headers, or cinematic visuals. | Represents prestige, sovereignty, and the foundational identity of the Noreum Network. |
| **Black Logo** (`noreum-logo-black.png`) | Technical, documentation, or internal development use — including GitHub repos, dashboards, and infrastructure references. | Represents neutrality, clarity, and focus on the technical layer. |

Do **not** alter proportions, color tones, or internal spacing.  
Do **not** apply gradients, shadows, or glow effects unless explicitly approved by the Noreum Foundation design team.

Whenever possible, maintain **minimum clear space** equal to the height of the “N” character around the logo to ensure visual integrity.

**Visual Identity Reference:**  
All official colors, typography, and iconography are documented in the internal *Noreum Design Manifest* and must align with its standards.
